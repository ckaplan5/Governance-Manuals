        <p class="Body">The following tips help facilitate script recording:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">When recording, do not use the scroll bars, cursor keys or the mouse to change the position because these actions do not get recorded. Successful recordings need to be done with the Page Down key. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">For efficiency, do not hit the Enter or the Return key unless it is absolutely necessary. &#160; </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">Be careful when selecting views. The data being recorded may require more or fewer views than other data. If this is the case, view selections may not be synchronized with the recording and cause the wrong views to be selected during the post. Avoid this issue by selecting all views, even if all views will not be used. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">When the header information has been entered on a multi-line transaction, it is good practice to force a screen break to separate the header and line item screens. This practice makes it easier to identify where the header information ends and the line item detail begins. To force a screen break, click the Enter key. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">It is important to know the transaction and the required data before the recording process starts.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">Record generically. The transaction must work for all objects, such as material types in materials or account groups in customers. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">Keep the number of screens to a minimum. For example, Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span> rather than having the transaction ask to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span>. Avoid using list boxes. Know the transaction and what information is used to populate the fields prior to executing the recording. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">Populate as many fields as necessary to map in the recording. Missing fields can be added later to the script, but it is better to record the fields needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">If the SAP screen includes a table, look for a way to move to the end of the table in order to enter the data in the same field subscript on the screen, either line one or two. Often, there is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Line</span> button available to move the table and position the cursor at the end. If this button fails, insert the data on the bottom line and move it up to the first free line.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">Recordings should <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #FF0000;text-decoration: underline;">not</span> be <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span>d in the same directory that the platform will later <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span> the file once it is imported. Saving the recording as an imported file in the same directory can cause an error or duplicate file. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">Ensure the language for fields in the view (e.g., UOM) matches the default SAP language for the SAP login. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">Ensure the number and date formats in the view match the format in the SAP login. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Rules for MM01</span> – Be careful using the MM01 transaction. Different materials types may have the views assigned in different sequences. If needed, go to the second page and replace <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enter</span> on the recording of that page with <span style="font-weight: bold;">P++</span>. This replacement causes a page to appear at the bottom of the selection window.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Rules for MM02</span> – When changing a view, <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #FF0000;text-decoration: underline;">always</span> select the basic view first. Use the list box on the right side of the screen to locate the views that are to be changed. The views set up for the given material determine the contents of the list box. Do not record a direct selection to the view to be changed.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">For Customer and Vendor add or update transactions, the user is able to select the desired views; selection fields are not configurable. </li>
        </ul>
