        <p>Roles within a Template can be dependent on other roles, meaning one role cannot be finished until another is completed. Dependencies drive the workflow notification process by emailing the user assigned to the next dependent role.</p>
        <p>Dependent roles run according to what is called <span style="font-style: italic;">upstream dependency</span>, meaning if Role 2 is dependent on Role 1 and Role 3 is dependent on Role 2, Role 3 must be defined to be dependent on both Role 1 and Role 2, even though it is not directly dependent on Role 1.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;">A role’s priority should also control how dependencies are created. Roles should never be available for processing until the roles on which they depend have been processe</span><span style="color: #000000;">d. F</span><span style="color: #000000;">or example, a role with priority of 50 </span><span style="color: #000000;">should</span><span style="color: #000000;"> become available for processing before a role with priority of 30 or 40 had been processed.</span>
        </p>
        <p>The dependencies configured for global roles are automatically added to template roles. The Review role is dependent on the Data role. The Post role is dependent on the Data Role and the Review role. These dependencies cannot be changed at the global level. </p>
