        <p>Once an external request scenario for an Excel-initiated request has been created and the Excel file to be used with the scenario has been uploaded and processed, the columns in that Excel file must be mapped to columns in the staging table.</p>
        <p>As a result of the mapping, when request data, submitted in an Excel file by an external contact, is moved from the staging table to the table used for the Data Entry role for the request, it is either:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">Copied from the staging table to the table used for the Data Entry role for the request or</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">Replaced by a fixed value</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An Excel file must have been successfully processed for the scenario prior to performing these steps. If a Template uses an external request scenario that creates Excel-initiated requests, that Template cannot be activated until at least one of the columns in the Excel file has been mapped to the Template columns on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Template (External Request Scenario Column)</span> page. </p>
        <p>Columns should always be mapped for the role with the lowest priority. If columns have been mapped to the Excel file, a new role with a lower priority than the role for which columns have been mapped cannot be added. For example, the Data Entry role has a priority of 20 on a Template and Template columns have been mapped to the Excel file for the External Request Scenario for this Data Entry role. A role with a lower priority than 20 cannot be added to the Template. </p>
        <p>To map the columns:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 25pt;" start="1">
            <li class="NumberedList">Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Map Sheet Columns</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 13pt;"><img src="../Resources/Images/Information Steward Accelerator Fundamentals (6.2)/Global Roles_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 18px;height: 16px;" /></span>.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Highlight all records.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit</span> button.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Map the columns based on the screenshot.</li>
        </ol>
