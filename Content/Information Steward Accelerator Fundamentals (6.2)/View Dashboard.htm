        <p>The charts on the ISA dashboard provide summary data about the number of records that fail IS rules. The charts display data based on these project distributions or users.</p>
        <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Total Records</span> Chart drills down through failed record counts for rules per Project Distributions. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Records by</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">User</span> Chart drills down through failed record counts for rules per users.</p>
        <p>Each bar chart has a corresponding line chart to track trends (i.e., how the number of records that have failed changes over time). For example, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Records by Project </span>Chart displays a count for each project for the current day, while its corresponding <span style="font-weight: bold;">Record Trend by Project</span> chart displays how the number of failed records changed for each project over a period of time.</p>
        <p>Bar charts allow a user to drill down, trend charts display data only.</p>
        <p>Charts display:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">Metrics for up to 10 days, depending on the Days to Retain Metrics field</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">The 10 rules that have the highest number of failed records</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data on charts displays based on the Days to Retain Metrics setting, which can be set at the Parameter level (Configuration &gt; Parameters &gt; Basic Settings). Metrics can be retained for up to 10 days. Additionally, each project has its own Days to Retain Metrics setting (set on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Vertical View</span> of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Project Summary</span> page), which, if set, will override the setting in Parameters.</p>
        <p>When the user drills down through the charts to the Report Data Viewer, the count of records on the Report Data Viewer may be lower than the counts on the charts. User filters are applied to reports, but not to the metrics in charts. A user only views reports to which that user has access through project distribution assignments. This is to restrict access based on a user’s security settings.</p>
