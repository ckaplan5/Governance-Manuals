        <p>Workflow options set how and whether or not users receive information about data that failed IS rules. A user may receive an email with an attachment in the form of an Excel file, a summary in the body of the email with the count of failed records and a link to the ISA to view additional details, or may not receive notification. Workflows are sent when rules have been run in IS (with a slight delay for processing time).</p>
