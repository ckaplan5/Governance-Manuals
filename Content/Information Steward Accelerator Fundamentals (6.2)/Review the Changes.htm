        <p>After the Data Role has finished, the Review Role receives an email and/or notification within the DSP indicating there is a Request ready for review.</p>
        <p>The Template is configurable to allow partial approval for a request. The Review role can reject only the data that is not correct instead of rejecting all the data within the request. The User assigned to the Review Role can reject individual records by clicking the check box for any record or the entire Request on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Request (Roles</span>) page.</p>
        <p>Templates can also be configured for <span style="font-style: italic;">Comparison Approval</span>. It allows the Review Role to see the current SAP field value as well as the value the field will be changed to as a result of the data entry process. The Review Role can compare the current-state and the future-state of records before any changes take place. </p>
