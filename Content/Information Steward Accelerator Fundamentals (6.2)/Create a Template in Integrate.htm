        <p>Integrate is an automation tool that allows experienced SAP users to leverage data loading capabilities provided by SAP. Knowledge of how to use SAP loading technologies such as BDC is required to use Integrate and the documentation and technical support included does not cover specific usage details or how this technology works. The use cases provided are examples only and do not supply comprehensive instructions to suit all situations.</p>
        <p>Integrate is organized into Categories, Templates and Processes. A Template is based on a Template type and defines how data is posted into an ERP system. Templates are not tied to data, but rather act as an independent guide for posting that can be assigned to many processes. A process is tied to data and is a series of posting steps that defines how Integrate takes data from the component and loads it into SAP. A Category is a grouping of Templates and processes and is used for organizational and management purposes.</p>
