        <p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Comparison Approval</span> functionality allows the user assigned to the Review role to see the current SAP field value as well as the value the field will be changed to as a result of the data entry process. The Review role can then easily compare the current state and the future state of records before any changes take place. The Review role has the ability to reject any changes and keep the original values.</p>
