The column names in the table match the column names listed on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Report Data Viewer</span> page for the associated ISA report. In some cases, the staging table may need to be rebuilt, for example, if bindings on the report in IS are changed. Clear the staging table by clicking Clear Staging Area, then click Build Staging Area. </p>
