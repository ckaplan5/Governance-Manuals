        <p>Once all the connections are configured, the rules in IS need to be run and the current projects that contain the rules in IS need to be imported into the ISA using the DSP™ component called Collect. </p>
        <p>Collect maintains a unified collection of data from multiple, disparate systems. It connects to a variety of data sources to extract and collect data into a single database. Collect provides access to data that resides in multiple systems without requiring users to connect to the actual systems. It can be configured to extract the data at scheduled intervals and at an individual table level. In this way, the data can be kept in sync based on the processing schedule of each data source.</p>
        <p>Once the IS rules are run, the purpose of refreshing the target is to keep the tables in sync with Information Steward. It pulls the information in from IS to be used within ISA. Collect can be configured to refresh the tables on a schedule to ensure the ISA and IS are in synch. </p>
        <p>Users will understand how to run the rules and import and refresh the project reviewed in Information Steward into ISA using the Collect component of DSP.</p>
        <p>For the purpose of this training, the IS rules have been created and the ISA Training Project has already been imported but will be refreshed, the Instructor will demonstrate the following steps.</p>
