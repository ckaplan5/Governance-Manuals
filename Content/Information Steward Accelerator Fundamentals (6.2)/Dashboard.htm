        <p>The Reports are organized within Projects. The rules from Information Steward are imported into ISA and are assigned to a Project. Each Project must have at least one Distribution, which are groups of users. </p>
        <p>When the Distribution is created, the Distribution Owner is automatically registered as a user for the Distribution. The Distribution Owner is the primary contact of information for the data quality rules configured in the Distribution.</p>
        <p>Additional users can be added to the Distribution. Once a rule is run in IS and ISA the users assigned to the Distribution receive an email regarding the failed data.</p>
        <p>For the purpose of this exercise, the Project and Distribution has already been set up.</p>
        <p>To view the report:</p>
