        <p>Once a Request has been generated from ISA, a notification in DSP and/or a workflow email is sent to the person responsible for updating the missing Postal Code fields.</p>
        <p>Workflow is a notification method called from within a WebApp when a role is finished. It serves as a means to deliver tasks by sending emails and/or notifications within DSP to users assigned to a particular role. When one stage of work has been completed for a request, an email is sent notifying all members of the subsequent role(s) that they have a role to complete. Links are provided in the email to trigger specific events and to launch the relevant page in the WebApp. </p>
        <p>When a role is finished by the person responsible, an email notification is sent to the next person(s) responsible for subsequent role(s). </p>
        <p>To process the request:</p>
