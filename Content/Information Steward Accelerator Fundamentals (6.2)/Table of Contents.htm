        <p>Data, and the information created from data, are widely known as enterprise assets. Making better informed and more effective and profitable decisions, requires a high level of data quality. Data Quality strengthens many business activities and processes. If an organization is experiencing business process interruptions such as late shipments, errors in billing or accounting, inventory does not match to materials, there is high likelihood the data quality is affecting the bottom line.</p>
        <p>Risk management is directly affected by data quality, particularly if upstream sign-offs are dependent on good information about process and approvals.</p>
        <p>New Product Introductions and changes in legacy or other systems depend on data quality for accurate delivery dates, operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 3pt;margin-bottom: 3pt;">SAP Information Steward Accelerator (ISA) Solution bridges the gap between IT and the business users. It helps companies jumpstart stalled data quality remediation efforts by linking poor data quality to real world business processes and by alerting data stewards of remediation actions to quickly establish a documented, repeatable best-practice process of identifying and resolving enterprise wide data quality issues. Business users that may lack IT or data quality expertise can enjoy simplified and error-free data quality error remediation and reporting using the software’s preconfigured reporting templates and automated, best-practice workflow. </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 3pt;margin-bottom: 3pt;">ISA expands a company’s network of business users that are actively engaged in improving data quality. It automatically routes data alerts to the appropriate data owner. It can be configured with appropriate roles, approvals, and error routing reusing the existing business user accounts and roles in ISA to match the responsibilities of the data steward. </p>
