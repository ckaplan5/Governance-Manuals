        <p>In addition to generating a request from the Report Data Viewer page in ISA, users can create a request by sending an email with an Excel file attached. For example, the ISA workflow sends an email with the Report attached in an Excel file. The Excel can be updated and submitted to dspCompose to go through the workflow. </p>
        <p>The Templates in dspCompose must be configured to generate a request by sending an Excel file via Email. The Excel file provides data for the first Data Entry role in the workflow. In this case, not only will the request be created, but the worksheet data from the Excel file will be inserted into the table used by the first Data Entry role (after certain conditions are met). This type of request is called an Excel-initiated request.</p>
        <p>For Templates that use scenarios that create Excel-initiated requests, emails can have an Excel file attached that contains more than one worksheet so that more than one Template external request scenario can be processed with one email. The subject line for external emails for Excel-initiated requests must include the text entered in the Subject Alias field for at least one of the Sheet Names that match a worksheet in the email. dspCompose creates a request for every worksheet name that matches a sheet name for an External Request Scenario.</p>
        <p>To use an external request scenario that creates an Excel-initiated request:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li class="ListBullet_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">An email polling process runs, locates the email, and checks the email for an alias in the subject line that corresponds to a subject alias saved for an external request scenario that creates Excel-initiate requests. </li>
        </ul>
