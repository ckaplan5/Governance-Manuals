        <p class="Note"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span>Priority also controls how dependencies are created. Roles should never be available for processing until the roles on which they depend have been processed. For example, a role with priority of 50 should never become available for processing before a role with priority of 30 or 40 had been processed. The roles <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #FF0000;">must</span> have <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #FF0000;">different</span> priorities.</p>
