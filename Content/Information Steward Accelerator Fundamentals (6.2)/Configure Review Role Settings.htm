        <p>In addition to Comparison Approval, Template can be configured to Allow Partial Approval; the Review role user can reject only the data that is not correct instead of rejecting all the data in the request. The default for the Partial Approval setting is determined by the setting on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Parameters</span> page in dspCompose™. If Allow Partial Approval is enabled on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Vertical</span> View of the Review Role, the Review Role is able to reject or approve request data by row, allowing different users assigned to the Review role to be responsible for reviewing specific data. A new request is created for all rejected records. </p>
