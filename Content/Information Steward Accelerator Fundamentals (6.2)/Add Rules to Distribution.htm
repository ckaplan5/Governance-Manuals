        <p>Add rules to a project Distribution to send failed records from the rule to users who belong to the Project Distribution. If a rule has a rule status of Approved in IS, it will be available to be added to all projects. If the rule has any other status, it will only be available to be added to the project in which the rule was built.</p>
        <p>If a rule is bound to a single table on multiple fields, each binding will generate a spreadsheet to send as an attachment to users in the project distribution. The spreadsheet will contain data that failed the rule for each field-table combination. </p>
